    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Setting up Octopress has been quite easy and straightforward following the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation</a>. The only slight problem I found was with regard the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">deployment to github</a>. The first step there for deploying with a Github user / organization is:</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages
</code></pre>

<p>This script ask you for your Github repository url. From the documentation it could seem that they were referring to the Pages url http://albertovilla.github.com. If you use that as the URL you will find a strange error (the error description will not provide you any hint on the real issue).</p>

<p>Once I used the right URL git@github.com:albertovilla/albertovilla.github.com.git everything went fine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First things first. So, what’s Pomodoro Technique? It’s a just simple method to improve the way you approach task completion by putting your focus on a single task at a time.</p>

<p>The idea is not new, it’s clear that focusing on a task and removing distractions will allow you to accomplish more.</p>

<p>This post provides a very short summary of the technique and an alternative template to be used when applying the technique. If you want a really detailed description you may download for <em>free</em> the <a href="http://bit.ly/sAM6kF">book</a> from the official Pomodoro Technique <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">webpage</a>. There is also a <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/pomodoro_cheat_sheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a> where you may find a more detailed summary of the method.</p>

<p>The way Pomodoro technique works is basically as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a list of the tasks you want to accomplish today.</li>
<li>Pick the most important task of your list and work on it until it’s finished.</li>
<li>Once you’ve selected a task, you have to work on that task  — and only that — for 25 minutes. When the session is complete, you mark a Pomodoro in the sheet and take a short break (3-5 minutes) and perform another 25 focused effort.</li>
<li>When you’ve done that four times then you take a longer break.</li>
</ul>


<p>In an ideal world, the above could be accomplished easily, however, in the real world there are <em>interruptions</em>. The Pomodoro technique explains how to deal with them, both internal and external ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each internal interruption (e.g. you remember about another task you have to do) you include an apostrophe (‘) in the sheet to the right of the task you were working on and make a note of whatever was disturbing you either in the <em>Unplanned &amp; Urgent</em> section or in the <em>Activity Inventory</em>, then you continue with the current task.</li>
<li>For external interruptions (e.g. a colleague seeks advise with regards to a problem) you include a dash (-) in the sheet to the right of the task you were working on and apply the Inform, Negotiate and Call strategy which consists in agreeing with the disturbing person with a time when you may tackle the issue he/she wanted to address now (note: if you cannot stop the interruption then the Pomodoro must be declared void and start again the Pomodoro).</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to implement the Pomodoro technique you need just two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A timer, either a physical one (recommended in the book) or a digital one; I’m using the <a href="http://www.focusboosterapp.com/">Focus Booster</a>, it’s free and works fine for me.</li>
<li>A TODO worksheet. In the Pomodoro Technique official page they offer one but I’ve designed my own that you can download right <a href="http://alberto-villa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Pomodoro-Template.pdf">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the worksheet I’ve included some elements that you may find useful such as a field to estimate the number of Pomodoros you believe you will perform today and another one to record the real number (you may be surprised with the way we overestimate our performance), a field to record the total number of internal and external interruptions, and some space to record the interruptions beside the Pomoro boxes for each task.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
